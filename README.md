# HelixToolkit Nex

HelixToolkit Nex is the next-generation graphics engine from HelixToolkit. It offers a unified graphics interface designed to support multiple backend implementations, with an initial focus on Vulkan.

The graphics interface and Vulkan backend are largely inspired by [LightWeightVk](https://github.com/corporateshark/lightweightvk).
